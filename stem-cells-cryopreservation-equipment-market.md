<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cells Cryopreservation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell cryopreservation equipment is essential for preserving stem cells at ultra-low temperatures. The market is divided into two main types: liquid phase and vapor phase. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves storing samples directly in liquid nitrogen, allowing for stable temperature control, ideal for short-term storage. Vapor phase cryopreservation, on the other hand, uses gaseous nitrogen above the liquid, protecting samples from direct contact, which reduces contamination risk and offers better long-term storage stability while maintaining optimal temperatures.</p></p>
