<p><h1>Global Coal-fired Power Generation Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2025 to 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Coal-fired Power Generation Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Coal-fired power generation involves the combustion of coal to produce electricity, making it one of the most established energy sources worldwide. The process typically includes pulverizing coal, burning it to generate heat, and using that heat to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators.</p><p>In recent years, the Coal-fired Power Generation Market has faced various challenges due to shifting energy policies, environmental concerns, and the rise of renewable energy sources. However, demand for coal remains strong in certain regions, particularly in developing economies where industrialization and growing electricity needs drive production. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% during the forecast period, supported by initiatives to modernize existing coal plants and incorporate cleaner technologies.</p><p>Latest trends show a rising focus on improving efficiency and reducing emissions through advanced coal technologies, such as supercritical and ultra-supercritical systems. Additionally, some countries are also exploring carbon capture and storage (CCS) to mitigate environmental impacts. Overall, while the landscape is evolving, coal-fired power generation continues to play a vital role in the global energy mix.</p></p>

<p><strong>Coal-fired Power Generation Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The coal-fired power generation market is characterized by diverse players, with significant footprints primarily in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Key players include China Datang, China Huaneng, Korea Electric Power, and NTPC in Asia; American Electric Power, Dominion Energy Solutions, and Duke Energy in the U.S.; and E.ON and RWE in Europe.</p><p>**China Datang** is one of the largest coal-fired generation companies in China, with a generation capacity exceeding 100 GW. The company has been investing in upgrading its plants to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, which positions it well for future growth in an increasingly regulated environment.</p><p>**China Huaneng** has a similar capacity and is leveraging technology enhancements to boost emissions control. As of recent reports, Huaneng expected stable growth due to China's energy demand rebound post-pandemic, forecasting revenue expansions driven by a mix of coal- and renewable-based generation.</p><p>**American Electric Power (AEP)** reported revenues of approximately $16.2 billion in recent years, primarily from its coal operations but is focusing on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, signaling a shift in future strategies amid regulatory pressures and market trends favoring renewables.</p><p>**Duke Energy**, with revenues around $24 billion, operates mainly in the Southeast U.S. and has pledged to decrease its reliance on coal, investing in renewable energy and natural gas. This strategic pivot suggests potential growth in greener energy sectors while maintaining some coal operations.</p><p>Collectively, these companies form a competitive landscape that is evolving with regulatory frameworks and market demands for cleaner energy. While coal remains a significant energy source today, future growth will likely need to align with sustainability trends, presenting both challenges and opportunities for traditional coal players.</p></p>

<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Coal-fired Power Generation Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The coal-fired power generation market is experiencing a gradual decline due to increasing environmental regulations and competition from renewable energy sources. In 2023, coal power accounted for approximately 35% of global electricity generation, a decrease from 40% in 2015. Emerging markets in Asia remain reliant on coal for energy security, albeit with rising investments in cleaner technologies. As countries strive for carbon neutrality by 2050, the outlook for coal is increasingly bearish, with a projected annual decline of 3-5% over the next decade. Transitioning to sustainable energy will define market dynamics, compelling coal operators to innovate or retire.</p></p>
